# Phylogenetic-tree-builder-and-evaluator
This code is used to build a phylogenetic tree from data derived from fasta files.
Distance matrix is built using either global pairwise alignment or kmer. 
phylogenetic tree is built using upgma algorithm. 
eval_distance is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the topology of a phylogenetic tree built from data from a regular fasta file containing multiple sequences, and a similar file after it underwent msa with clustalw.
